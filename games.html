  <p>Roblox is a gaming platform that allows you to play dozens of user-created games or create games through Roblox Studio1. It is not a single game, but an online platform where players can build and share creations with other users from all over the world2. Players can buy, sell, and create virtual items which can be used to decorate their virtual character that serves as their avatar on the platform3. Roblox experiences are places where users can socialize, build their own spaces, and even earn and spend virtual money4</p>
